# Magento-1.9-32-Bit-Vagrant-Box-Non-VT-x-AMD-v-
This repo will allow you to run a vagrant box for local Magento development. This was developed to fix the issue with development on computers without virtualization technology (VT-x/AMD-v). When the script is complete, you will have a fully functional Vanilla Magento install for local development.
